Followed the first tasks until the Dom fairly easily. Then attempted the Dom which took me a little while to get used to however think I mostly understand it now and can recreate it fairly easily. Was very excited when it worked however notcied you have no idea what the computers choice was and so the only way you knew if you won was by comparing the wins on the left which wasn't great.

Tried to add imgaes using the Dom which I struggled a little with. Ended up working out how, but I've had to check to see if an image is there before removing it and adding a new photo. I'm wondering if there's an easier way of doing this?

Changed some things here and there to try and make it more eppealing to play which I'm quite happy with however I'm not quite satisfied with how the website looks as a whole. That's definitely the area which I'm finding hardest at the moment.

Overall I really enjoyed this! Every little thing from functions, Dom to even limiting a text input to 10 characters I felt like I was learning and adding to my knowledge.
